# COE 1502

Advanced Digital Design

## Description

This subfolder contains projects for COE1502, taught by Samuel Dickerson during the Fall semester of 2017. They are written 
in VHDL, and were sythesized onto an Altera Cyclone III DE0 FPGA.

## Projects

Includes code for the following assignements:

*   MIPS ALU
*   Gray Code Counter
*   Simple CheckSummer
*   Transmitter / Receiver CheckSummer
*   MIPS Pipelined CPU 

## Project Description

MIPS ALU -- 32 bit MIPS ALU containing custom Ripple-Carry Adder <br />
Gray Code Counter -- Up/Down gray code counter, where only 1 bit changes per cycle <br />
CheckSummer -- Error checking device that compares number of bits transmitted vs. total number of bits <br />
T / R CheckSummer -- Dual synthesization w/ a transmitting and receiving FPGA synthesization of a checksummer, respectivelly <br />
MIPS Pipelined CPU -- 5 stage Pipeline CPU implementing the MIPS instruction set (R, I, J),  w/ IF, ID, EX, MEM, & WB stages.
