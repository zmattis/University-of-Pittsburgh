# COE 1502

Advanced Digital Design

## Description

This subfolder contains projects for COE1502, taught by Samuel Dickerson during the Fall semester of 2017. They are written 
in VHDL, and were sythesized onto a Altera Cyclone III DE0 FPGA.

## Projects

Includes code for the following assignements:

*   MIPS ALU
*   Gray Code Counter
*   CheckSummer

## Project Description

MIPS ALU -- 32 bit MIPS ALU containing custom Ripple-Carry Adder <br />
Gray Code Counter -- Up/Down gray code counter, where only 1 bit changes per cycle <br />
CheckSummer -- Error checking device that compares number of bits transmitted vs. total number of bits <br />
