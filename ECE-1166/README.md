# ECE 1166 - Parallel Computer Architecture

Introduction to fundamental and newly developing hardware and software topics in parallel computer architecture (pca) including concepts, models, methods, metrics, systems, and applications. PCA has become one of the most challenging and important areas of ece, and it is now a dominant theme throughout computer architecture, systems, and programming, from low-power embedded systems to high-end supercomputers, and featuring various forms of fixed-logic (cpu, dsp, gpu), reconfigurable-logic (fpga), and hybrid (cpu+dsp, cpu+fpga, cpu+gpu, cpu+fpga+gpu) processing devices.
