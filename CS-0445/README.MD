# CS 0445 - Data Structures

This course emphasizes the study of the basic data structures of computer science (stacks, queues, trees, lists) and their implementations using the Java language. Included in this study are programming techniques which use recursion, reference variables, and dynamic memory allocation. Students in this course are also introduced to various searching and sorting methods and are expected to develop an intuitive understanding of the complexity of these algorithms.

## Description

This subfolder contains projects for CS0445, taught by Dr. John Ramirez during the Spring semester of 2016-2017 (Term 2174). They are written in the Java programming language.
