# ECE 1150 - Computer Networks

The course will cover the understanding technologies where methods of interconnection are fundamental to the system design. Interconnection will include serial point to point and multiple access serial/parallel methods and protocols. There will be an emphasis on fundamentals related to wireless network systems and networks of computers or embedded digital devices. Coverage will include small wireless devices that may be passive or battery powered - requiring low power devices and protocols in either case.
