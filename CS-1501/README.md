# CS 1501 - Algorithm Implementation

This course covers a broad range of the most commonly used algorithms. Some examples include: algorithms for sorting, searching, encryption, graph searching, pattern matching, geometric intersection, compression, and local search. The students will implement and test several algorithms. The course is programming-intensive.

## Description

This subfolder contains projects for CS1501, taught by Nicholas Farnan during the Fall semester of 2017-2018 (Term 2181). They are written in the Java programming language.
