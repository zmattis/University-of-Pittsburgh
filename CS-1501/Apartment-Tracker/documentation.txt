Priority Queue Apartment Tracker Justification


For my implementation of the priority queue, I started with a boolean flag
that indicates whether the data structure is min (price) or max (sq ft)
heap. This priority queue contains implementations of methods for
both floating and sinking data based upon the apartment's prices and
square footage. This Priority Queue utilizes an R-way trie indirection
structure to index its positions in the heap. This trie data structure
stores the address, apartment number, and zip code as a concatenated
path down the trie, with each character representing a new node.
Additionally, a linked list data structure is used to hold the apartments
that share a city. These linked lists are stored in a hash table that uses
Horner's method on the apartment city to produce the hashing index. The
location within the hash table corresponds to the linked list for the
specified city, and a simplified heap is created (CityHeap) of that linked
list whenever the city is specified. The overall program loops through a
menu of the seven available options for the user, until he/she decides
to end the program (Option 8).
