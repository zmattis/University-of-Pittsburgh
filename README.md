# University of Pittsburgh

Repository containing the assignments I completed as a Computer Engineering student at the University of Pittsburgh.

## Description

This is a repo containing nearly all of the projects I did as a Computer Engineering student at the University of Pittsburgh. Many of these projects covered fundamental topics that are critical for any coder, so I wanted to provide them as examples and possible starting points for any project.

They are (generally) written in Java, C, Python, or VHDL, and may be complete programs, or merely code snippets.
