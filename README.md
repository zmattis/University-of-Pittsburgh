Repository containing the assignments I completed as a Computer Engineering student at the University of Pittsburgh.

## Description

This is a repo containing nearly all of the projects I did as a Computer Engineering student at the University of Pittsburgh. Many of these projects covered fundamental topics that are critical for any coder, so I wanted to provide them as examples and possible starting points for any project.

They are (generally) written in Java or C, and may be complete programs, or merely code snippets.

## Class and Project Information

Includes projects for the following classes:
*   CS 0401 - Intermediate Programming Using Java
*   CS 0445 - Data Structures
*   CS 0447 - Computer Organization and Assembly Language
*   CS 0449 - Introduction to Systems Software
*   CS 1501 - Algorithm Implementation
*   CS 1550 - Introduction to Operating Systems
