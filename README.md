Repository containing the projects I completed as a Computer Engineering student at the University of Pittsburgh.

## Description

This is a repo containing nearly all of the projects I did as a Computer Engineering student at the University of Pittsburgh. Many of these projects covered fundamental topics that are critical for any coder, so I wanted to provide them as examples and possible starting points for any project.

They are (generally) written in Java or C, and may be complete programs, or merely code snippets.
