# ECE 1770

Microprocessors

## Description

This subfolder contains projects for ECE1770, taught by Dr. Jingtong Hu during the Spring semester of 2018-2019. They are written using ARM assembly and C.

## Microcontroller

All projects for this course were built utilizing the Keil uVision 5 IDE, targeting an ARM STMicroelectronics STM32L476VGTx development board. Source files and libraries for this board can be found in its development folder.


## Projects

Includes code for the following assignments:

*   LCD Display
*   Register Memory
*   Flow Control
*   Bubble Sort
*   Functions and Subroutines
*   GPIO

## Project Description
