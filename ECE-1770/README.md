# ECE 1770 - Microprocessors

The purpose of this course is to introduce you to the microprocessors and I/Os. You will learn these things while studying the fundamentals of ARM assembly language and various I/O configurations. The course begins with an introduction to ARM processor, I/O registers. ARM assembly programming languages are introduced then. During the second half of the semester we will study interrupts, along with the very important topic of timers. You will obtain a useful understanding of the ARM processor and application of micro-controllers in class and in lab.

## Description

This subfolder contains projects for ECE1770, taught by Dr. Jingtong Hu during the Spring semester of 2018-2019 (Term 2194). They are written using ARM assembly and C.

## Microcontroller

All projects for this course were built utilizing the Keil uVision 5 IDE, targeting an ARM STMicroelectronics STM32L476VGTx development board. Source files and libraries for this board can be found in its development folder.


## Projects

Includes code for the following assignments:
  - LCD Display
  - Register Memory
  - Flow Control
  - Bubble Sort
  - Functions and Subroutines
  - GPIO
  - Stepper Motor
